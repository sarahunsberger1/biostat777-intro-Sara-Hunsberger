    "text": "Educational Background:\nI grew up in Washington DC and attended the School without Walls high shcool. I then went on to study math at Haverford College, where I also completed a minor in chemistry and a minor in spanish. Throughout college I tried to merge my interests in math and science, I did research in a computational chemistry lab at Haverford and did a mathematical biology summer research experience. All of these experiences led me to want to see new ways that science and math could be used together to explain the world. I continued this path working at a biotech startup after graduating from college. During that job I realized that biostatistics was the field where I could apply math to explain scientific phenomena and I applied for my PHD. I am very excited to be starting my PHD here at Johns Hopkins and am excited to learn even more ways to apply statistics and math to science.\nHobbies:\nI was a setter on the volleyball team at Haverford College so I am now trying to find places to play in Baltimore. I also love to play board games and card games, my favorite at the moment is Bohnanza. Finally, I like to go backpacking and camping and worked at a summer camp for a few summers leading backpacking trips for young people."

I then clean the data by dropping all NA values and selecting only the variables that I care about for this analysis. For the purposes of this analysis I only want to look at games that had a clear winner and did not have a draw, so I filtered the data based on games that did not end in a draw. Finally, I made a new column that is the difference between the white player ranking and the black player ranking because I am interested in how well this difference can describe how the game is played and the outcome.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# read the data from Git\nchess &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-10-01/chess.csv')\n\n# look at the data\nnames(chess)\n\n [1] \"game_id\"        \"rated\"          \"start_time\"     \"end_time\"      \n [5] \"turns\"          \"victory_status\" \"winner\"         \"time_increment\"\n [9] \"white_id\"       \"white_rating\"   \"black_id\"       \"black_rating\"  \n[13] \"moves\"          \"opening_eco\"    \"opening_name\"   \"opening_ply\"   \n\n# drop any na rows in  the dataframe\nchess &lt;- drop_na(chess)\n\n# select a couple continuous variables to look at\nvars &lt;- c(\"turns\", \"winner\" , \"white_rating\", \"black_rating\",\"time_increment\", \"victory_status\")\nchess&lt;- chess %&gt;% select(vars)\n\n# filter the data to only games with a winner, no draws\nchess &lt;- chess %&gt;% filter(chess$winner != \"draw\")\n\n# make a column that shows the difference between the white and black ranking\nchess &lt;- chess %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    dif_rank = white_rating-black_rating\n  )\n\n# rename to make more clear\nchess &lt;- rename(chess, time = time_increment)\n\n\n\nPlotting\nIn this section I create multiple plots to examine the data. I am interested in how the rankings of the players affects the outcome. Each of the following plots shows a different aspect of how the rankings of the players relate to other variables measured about the games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay Attention\n\n\n\nThe difference in ranking variable used in the next few plots was calculated by subtracting the black player ranking from the white player ranking. This means that larger values of this variable mean that the white player has a much higher ranking, while negative values mean that the black player has a higher ranking. Values around 0 mean that the players are closer in ranking.\n\n\n\n# set the theme for ggplot\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\n# make a box plot that compares the difference in ranking to the winner\np &lt;- ggplot(chess, aes(winner, dif_rank, fill=winner))\np + geom_boxplot()+ theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)) + ggtitle(\"Ranking vs Winnner\", subtitle=\"Ranking difference of white minus black compared to the winner\") + labs(y = \"Difference in ranking (white ranking - black ranking)\", x = \"Winner\", caption= \"The boxplot on the left shows the spread in the difference in ranking for games where the black player won. \\nThe right boxplot shows the spread in the difference in ranking when the white player won. \\nIt looks like in both cases on average the ranking of the player who won was higher.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# make a scatter plot to compare the difference in rating to the number of moves and the type of win\ne &lt;- ggplot(chess, aes(dif_rank, turns, color='orange'))\ne + geom_point() + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0))+ggtitle(\"Turns vs. Difference in Ranking\", subtitle=\"Ranking difference compared to the number of turns taken in the game\") + labs(x = \"Difference in ranking (white ranking - black ranking)\", y = \"Turns\", caption= \"This scatter plot shows how many turns a game took when for the different rankings of players. \\nOn the either extreme of the difference in ranking (meaning one player was ranked much higher than others) \\nwe generally see lower number of turns.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf &lt;- e + geom_point()  + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)) + ggtitle(\"Turns vs. Difference in Ranking\", subtitle=\"Ranking difference compared to the number of turns in the game by the method of winning\") + labs(x = \"Difference in ranking (white ranking - black ranking)\", y = \"Turns\", caption= \"These scatter plots shows the difference in ranking compared to the number of turns taken in the game \\nfor every type of game ending.

    "text": "Summary\nOur goal from this analysis was to understand how the ranking of players affects the outcome of a chess match. When examining the data we created a variable looking at the difference in ranking of the white player and black player. We created a boxplot that showed us that when the white player won, the average difference in ranking was higher for the white player, and when the black player won the difference in ranking was higher for the black player. We later fit a logistic regression to find the relationship between the difference in ranking of the two players and the winner. This logistic regression had a very small p-value which tells us that there is likely a correlation between the difference in ranking of the two players and the winner of the game. I next wanted to look at if this difference in ranking affected the amount of turns a game took because my hypothesis was that if the difference in ranking was higher, than the player with the higher ranking may win in fewer turns. To examine this I plotted a scatter plot to look at the difference in ranking compared to the number of turns taken, in this scatter plot it looked like when the absolute value of the difference in ranking was large, then the game took less turns, this lined up with my hypothesis. I then fit a linear regression model with a degree 2 polynomial on the difference in ranking because the shape of the scatter plot looked more quadratic to me. The resulting p-value was very low which indicates there is a strong correlation between the difference in ranking and the number of turns a game took. From this analysis I think we have seen that the rankings of chess players on this website can provide a good indicator of the result of the game and also how the game will go in terms of the number of turns it may take."

    "text": "Educational Background:\nI grew up in Washington DC and attended the School without Walls high shcool. I then went on to study math at Haverford College, where I also completed a minor in chemistry and a minor in spanish. Throughout college I tried to merge my interests in math and science, I did research in a computational chemistry lab at Haverford and did a mathematical biology summer research experience. All of these experiences led me to want to see new ways that science and math could be used together to explain the world. I continued this path working at a biotech startup after graduating from college. During that job I realized that biostatistics was the field where I could apply math to explain scientific phenomena and I applied for my PHD. I am very excited to be starting my PHD here at Johns Hopkins and am excited to learn even more ways to apply statistics and math to science.\nHobbies:\nI was a setter on the volleyball team at Haverford College so I am now trying to find places to play in Baltimore. I also love to play board games and card games, my favorite at the moment is Bohnanza. Finally, I like to go backpacking and camping and worked at a summer camp for a few summers leading backpacking trips for young people."

    "text": "Summary\nOur goal from this analysis was to understand how the ranking of players affects the outcome of a chess match. When examining the data we created a variable looking at the difference in ranking of the white player and black player. We created a boxplot that showed us that when the white player won, the average difference in ranking was higher for the white player, and when the black player won the difference in ranking was higher for the black player. We later fit a logistic regression to find the relationship between the difference in ranking of the two players and the winner. This logistic regression had a very small p-value which tells us that there is likely a correlation between the difference in ranking of the two players and the winner of the game. I next wanted to look at if this difference in ranking affected the amount of turns a game took because my hypothesis was that if the difference in ranking was higher, than the player with the higher ranking may win in fewer turns. To examine this I plotted a scatter plot to look at the difference in ranking compared to the number of turns taken, in this scatter plot it looked like when the absolute value of the difference in ranking was large, then the game took less turns, this lined up with my hypothesis. I then fit a linear regression model with a degree 2 polynomial on the difference in ranking because the shape of the scatter plot looked more quadratic to me. The resulting p-value was very low which indicates there is a strong correlation between the difference in ranking and the number of turns a game took. From this analysis I think we have seen that the rankings of chess players on this website can provide a good indicator of the result of the game and also how the game will go in terms of the number of turns it may take."

My question:

Intended Audience:

Data description:

Data dictionary:


```{r load data}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# read the data from Git
chess <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-10-01/chess.csv')

# look at the data
names(chess)

# drop any na rows in  the dataframe
chess <- drop_na(chess)

# select a couple continuous variables to look at
vars <- c("turns", "winner" , "white_rating", "black_rating","time_increment", "victory_status")
chess<- chess %>% select(vars)

# filter the data to only games with a winner, no draws
chess <- chess %>% filter(chess$winner != "draw")

# make a column that shows the difference between the white and black ranking
chess <- chess %>%
  mutate(
    dif_rank = white_rating-black_rating
  )

# rename to make more clear
chess <- rename(chess, time = time_increment)

# make a box plot that compares the difference in ranking o the winner
p <- ggplot(chess, aes(winner, dif_rank))
p + geom_boxplot() 

# make a line plot to compare the difference in rating to the number of moves and the type of win
e <- ggplot(chess, aes(dif_rank, turns))
e + geom_point() 

f <- e + geom_point() 

# Use vars() to supply variables from the dataset:
f + facet_grid(rows = vars(victory_status))

g <- ggplot(chess, aes(dif_rank))
n <- g+ geom_histogram()
n + facet_wrap(vars(winner))

# replace every NA in the data frame 

```



I used the functions select, filter, rename,   from dplyr

I used the functions mutate, drop_na from tidyr

I used the functions geom_histogram(), geom_point() , geom_boxplot(), facet_wrap, and facet_grid from ggplot2.
